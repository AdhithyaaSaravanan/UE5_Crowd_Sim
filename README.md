# Unreal Engine 5 - Pedestrian System

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a crowd system in unreal engine 5.
The NPCs are driven to behave like pedestrians in a city, following basic
traffic rules. At the moment, the system uses the default UE5 Manny and Quinn models,
but that is easily customisable. The city asset used in the project is from the 
epic games market place: 
[Assetsville_Town](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/assetsville-town).  

The [documentation](Documentation.md) explains in detail all the components of the system and how to 
set it up. Refer to the demo videos to get an idea of how to setup the system, and 
example customisations.
